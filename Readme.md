# Scala Test Template

## Overview

This is a variant of the sbt getting-started tutorial [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html).

The purpose of this repo is to provide a minimum fileset required to get an sbt/metals project up-and-running, while still providing some basic functionality to demonstrate the scala workflow.

## Reference

* [SBT Native Packager commands](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/gettingstarted.html)
  * Docker commands, etc.
